# AppsScripts Modules

Create repos that doubles as an npm module and regular appsscipts project. Organize your code in modules and namespaces. Import other npm modules.

Your modules are bundled into `Bundle.js` file, exported in a native AppsScript manner, and availble in your project.

Then, use this repo to make a second project that builds on your first project.

## Getting Started

### Initialize

In github:

1. Click "Use as template"
2. Copy the `url` of the repo

In your local directory:

1. git init
2. git checkout -b main  # may not be necessary if default branch is already "main"
3. git remote add origin <url>
4. git pull
5. npm i
6. Adjust author info in `package.json`

### Write code

Write regular project files in `/src/scripts`, like and an `onSubmit` trigger. They will be in your project at the top level as normal.

Write modules in `/src/modules`, where you can `export` what you want to be exposed in your main project (via the `Import` global):

```js
// src/scripts/Code.js
function onSubmit (e) {
  const {Namespace} = Import;
  // Namespace is defined below in /modules
}
```

```js
// src/modules/index.js
import {inc} from './functions.js'
export const Namespace = {
    doSomething: inc
};
```

```js
// scr/modules/functions.js
export const inc = (num) => {
    return num += 1;
};
```

### Test

Optionally, use ava to unit test your modules

```
npm run test

  âœ” test increment

```

### Push to AppsScripts project

Clasp functions are included in the scripts for convenience, and to make sure you push from `build/` rather than `/src` as the source:

```
npm run clasp:create
npm run clasp:push
```

Note that 

```
npm run push
```

Conveniently builds the bundle and then pushes with clasp.

### Reuse

As long as the `main` key in `package.json` points to the main module (there has to be one, by default it's `index.js`), you can publish your modules as npm modules, which you can then import into your next project!
